## How to Play

Just like Tetris, move the block with the left, down, and right arrow keys ( ← / ↓ / → ), and rotate the block with the up arrow key ( ↑ ).

Move the character around with W/A/S/D. Aim the bow with Q/E, and shoot arrows using the space bar.

Every 20-30 seconds, a boss will spawn.

Defeat the boss by hitting it with arrows while avoiding its fireball attacks. Each boss will spawn with additional health and damage. Clearing rows of tetris blocks will heal the character and increase bow damage.

Try to get as many points as possible by clearing rows and defeating bosses!
